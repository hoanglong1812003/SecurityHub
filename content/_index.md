# Get started with AWS Security Hub

#### Overview

**AWS Security** Hub gives you a comprehensive view of high priority security alerts and compliance status across AWS accounts.

There are a variety of powerful security tools at your disposal, from firewalls or endpoint protection applications to security compliance and vulnerability scanning applications. But sometimes, this causes your team to switch back and forth between these tools to deal with hundreds, if not thousands, of security alerts every day. With Security Hub, you now have a single place to aggregate, organize, and prioritize security alerts or detections from multiple AWS services (such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, and Amazon Macie) or from other solutions. solution provided by an AWS partner.

The risks found are visually summarized on an integrated dashboard with charts and tables that you can interact with. You can also continuously monitor your system using automated compliance checks against best practices from AWS and the market standards your business is following.
